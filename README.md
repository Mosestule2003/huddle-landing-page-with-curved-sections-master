## My process

- This project is comprised of five sections;
 1. Page-one
 2. Page-two
 3. Page-three
 4. Page-four
 5. footer
 - I started off by breaking down the required components for each page.
 - Setting up the tools needed for the prject followed.
 - In each section, I made use of custom names to best describe the type of content found in each container. eg(flex-container, grid-container).
- Mobile-first workflow.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I initially found it difficult to place the swirl background patterns for every grid-container. But with help from (https://www.stackoverflow.com) and (https://w3school.com), I was able to understand how to optimally place ht background patterns. 

### Useful resources

- [](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This helped me to understand fully how position absolute works. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
